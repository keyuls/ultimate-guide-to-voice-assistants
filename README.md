It will come as no surprise to those of you reading this (thanks!), that the
interest and applications of ‚ÄòVoice-Assistants‚Äô is growing rapidly. Amazon Alexa
[recently hit 10,000
skills](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/amazon-alexa-hits-10000-skills-plenty-room-grow/)
and there is talk around [what will drive
adoption](http://venturebeat.com/2017/02/25/heres-what-will-drive-adoption-for-another-10000-amazon-alexa-skills/)
for the next 10,000. I wont be diving into specifics and discussing issues like
[retention](http://www.recode.net/2017/1/23/14340966/voicelabs-report-alexa-google-assistant-echo-apps-discovery-problem).
That is not what this post is about.

> There are lots of resources & tools, tons of cool products, frameworks, articles
> and people out there to help you learn about the landscape.

###  Here are some that I find particularly useful 

"2017 will be a defining moment for voice. Voice-first devices shipped by year:

2015: 1.7 million,  
2016: 6.6 million,  
2017: 24.5 million"

###  How To Use This

** News**: There is very little on the newsletter front focusing on
Voice-Assistants. [Matt Hartman](https://medium.com/@MattHartman) does the best
one IMO.

> *I‚Äôm thinking of starting one too ‚Äî[if you‚Äôre interested, sign up!](https://upscri.be/146843-2)*

** Startups**: Always interesting to see the companies operating in these
spaces. They are broken down into different categories so you can easily jump
into ‚ÄòBuilding‚Äô, ‚ÄòProducts‚Äô, ‚ÄòAnalytics‚Äô etc. If you think there are some that
need adding,[tell me here](https://twitter.com/bentossell)**.**

** Funding:** This is just to outline some companies/funds that are very
focused in the space right now. Again, if I‚Äôve missed some worthwhile,[tell me here](https://twitter.com/bentossell)**.**

**üë• People & Posts:** These are some of the awesome people I follow and have
come across. I‚Äôve linked them all, you should check them out. If I‚Äôve missed
some worthwhile, you know to [tell me here](https://twitter.com/bentossell)**.**

### Enjoy üòä!

#### üöÄ I‚Äôve added a little note about [an experiment I‚Äôm working on](http://www.buildvoices.com/) at the end of this post. 
A community helping facilitate connections to;

with others<br> - Advice & mentorship from experienced individuals<br> -
Resources and tools to help you build<br> - Discover interesting products and
companies
